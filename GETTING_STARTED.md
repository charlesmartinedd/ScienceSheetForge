# ðŸš€ Getting Started with ScienceSheetForge

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Python
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed:
```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization Tips

### Change Character Styles
In `cell_hero_worksheet.py`, change the style parameter:
```python
character = generate_character_avatar(hero['name'], style="pixel-art")
```

Available styles:
- `adventurer` - Adventure characters
- `pixel-art` - Retro 8-bit style
- `lorelei` - Cartoon people
- `fun-emoji` - Emoji-style faces
- `bottts` - Robot characters
- `avataaars` - Avatar-style characters

### Adjust Worksheet Size
Change the DPI or dimensions:
```python
# For higher quality (300 DPI)
width, height = 2550, 3300  # 8.5x11 at 300 DPI

# For smaller file size (72 DPI)
width, height = 612, 792    # 8.5x11 at 72 DPI
```

### Add Your Branding
Edit the footer section to add your Teachers Pay Teachers shop name:
```python
draw.text((100, height - 80), "Created by YOUR SHOP NAME", fill='#95a5a6', font=text_font)
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Batch Generation

Create 20 different worksheets at once:

```python
for i in range(20):
    create_cell_hero_worksheet(f"worksheet_{i:02d}.png")
```

This creates:
- worksheet_00.png
- worksheet_01.png
- worksheet_02.png
- ... through worksheet_19.png

Each with different:
- Cell hero characters
- Emergency scenarios
- Random variations

## ðŸ“¤ Export to PDF

To convert PNG worksheets to PDF for Teachers Pay Teachers:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Single image to PDF
img = Image.open("cell_hero_worksheet.png")
img.save("cell_hero_worksheet.pdf", "PDF")

# Multiple images to one PDF
images = [Image.open(f"worksheet_{i:02d}.png") for i in range(5)]
images[0].save("worksheet_bundle.pdf", save_all=True, append_images=images[1:])
```

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
pip install requests Pillow
```

### Font errors on Windows
The script will automatically fall back to default fonts if Arial isn't found.

To use custom fonts:
```python
font = ImageFont.truetype("path/to/your/font.ttf", 48)
```

### API timeout errors
Some free APIs have rate limits. Add a small delay between requests:
```python
import time
time.sleep(1)  # Wait 1 second between API calls
```
