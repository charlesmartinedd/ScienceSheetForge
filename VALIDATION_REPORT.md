3. **Limited vocabulary** - 50 terms (goal: 100+)
4. **No batch generation** - Can only create one worksheet at a time
5. **No clipart** - Text-only design (could add images)

### Minor Issues:
- Unicode print errors on Windows (doesn't affect functionality)
- Web interface testing needs manual browser validation
- Some background processes need manual cleanup
