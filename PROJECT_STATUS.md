## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why "Smart Content Engine" instead of API?
1. **Reliability:** Works offline, no API rate limits
2. **Speed:** Instant generation, no network delays
3. **Quality:** Curated, educational content
4. **Control:** Easy to expand and customize
5. **Cost:** Completely free, no API costs

### Why Keep Existing UI?
- User already approved the design
- Modal-based workflow is intuitive
- Professional appearance
- Just needed better content generation

### Why 300 DPI?
- TPT standard for print quality
- Professional worksheet requirement
- Clear text and graphics when printed

---

## 🎓 Educational Content Quality

### Vocabulary Coverage:
- **Cell Biology:** 8 terms with full descriptions
- **Molecular Biology:** 3 terms
- **Energy/Processes:** 6 terms
- **Ecology:** 7 terms
- **Chemistry:** 3 terms
- **Total:** 27+ core terms (easily expandable)

### Definition Quality Example:
**Word:** mitochondria

- **Standard:** "The powerhouse organelle that produces energy (ATP)"
- **Kid-Friendly:** "The tiny power plant inside cells that makes energy"
- **Fun Fact:** "Mitochondria have their own DNA separate from the nucleus!"
- **Example:** "Mitochondria are like tiny batteries that keep cells running."

This multi-faceted approach makes content **engaging, educational, and age-appropriate**.
